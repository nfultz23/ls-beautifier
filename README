This is a Bash 'ls' command beautifier. Currenty, there are no options enabled, but in the
future I plan to add customizable colors for directories, links, and various extensions, as
well as custom ordering for groups of files.

To use the beautifier, please use the C compiler of your choice to compile the 'lsform.c'
file into an executable named '.lsform', then place it in the home directory alongside
your '.bashrc' file.

Inside your '.bashrc' file, add the following command:

       alias ls="ls -o --group-directories-first --human-readable -A > ~/.lstxt; ~/.lsform ${USER} < ~/.lstxt; rm ~/.lstxt"

Now, just call 'source ~/.bashrc' to make this work. Now, your 'ls' command is beautified!


Future plans:
 - Customizable sorting (directories first, links first, alphabetize all, etc.)
 - Customizable colors (plug in values from 1..255 to set colors)
 - Customizable file extensions (specify file types to recieve special colors)
 - Use a makefile to automatically update the .bashrc file with necessary targets
 - Add a help directive to explain the features when they're added
